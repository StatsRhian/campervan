* 2 nights

* Campsite at [Anglesey Outdoors](https://goo.gl/maps/fHSejee5sUvMZDHw7)

I booked a weekend Intro-mediate sea kayking course with [Sea Kayaking Anglesey](https://www.seakayakinganglesey.co.uk/). I'd done a course with them previously and really enjoyed it so thought I'd book another session. We headed down to North Wales quiet late as I'd been working in Northern Ireland all week and hadn't packed any kayaking gear. We did the obligatory A55 takeaway stop at Queensferry, Deeside. By the time we arrived at our wild camp spot it was time for bed.

In the morning, I think I'd forgotten where we were and was surprised to see the sea from the van door. I drove around the corner to the meet point at [Anglesea Outdoors](https://www.angleseyoutdoors.com/) which would also be our campsite for this evening.  James set off to explore the [North Coast](https://www.strava.com/activities/2692914274) of Anglesey by bike, whilst we headed to Menai Bridge. Most of the other paddlers were new to kayaking so I was relatively experienced by comparison (although that didn't stop me accidentally dropping the kayak!) We paddled in the sheltered stretch of the [Menai Strait](https://www.strava.com/activities/2688070335) and practised strokes and rescues.

We had a quiet evening on the campsite, grabbing food and a drink at [The Paddlers Return ](https://www.paddlersreturn.co.uk/). Both tired from an energetic day we had an early night. The next morning, James set off early cycling to [Llandudno](https://www.strava.com/activities/2692914022). I headed back over to the Paddlers Return for a coffee and to plan the day's paddling.

The decision was made to paddle from [Porth Dafarch to Trearddur Bay](https://www.strava.com/activities/2692178570). I've paddled here before and really enjoyed the rock hopping so it was nice to have the opportunity to return. As the day went on the swell increased, which gave us a good opportunity to practise our skills in choppier water. Phil was a fantastic coach over the two days and I left the course feeling even more inspired to get out sea kayaking.

When I arrived at Llandudno, James had just arrived and was waiting for me on the prom. We called in to my Nain and Taid's flat for a suprise visit, before grabbing a [chippy tea](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Barnacles+Fish+%26+Chips/@53.3222664,-3.8250898,17.22z/data=!4m13!1m7!3m6!1s0x4864e1e2afa75737:0x6c919e5e368577e0!2sLlandudno!3b1!8m2!3d53.324061!4d-3.827609!3m4!1s0x0:0x18f68e024ca96879!8m2!3d53.3224961!4d-3.8247258) and driving back up North.
