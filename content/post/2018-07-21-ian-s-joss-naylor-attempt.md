* 1 night
* Wild camp at [Pooley Bridge](https://goo.gl/maps/xDAtMUxnc8tGde718)

Ian was attempting the Joss Naylor, and James was supporting on leg one. This meant a 5am start from Pooley Bridge. Keen to use the van again, I suggested we camp up the night before, and found a small layby just outside Pooley Bridge where we could spend the night. 

On the drive up, we stopped at Haweswater and [walked up Branstree](https://www.strava.com/activities/1718350440). Back down by the reservoir we had a picnic of bulgar wheat and veg. In the evening, we drove to Pooley Bridge, parked up in the layby which was empty, and walked into the village for a pint at [The Sun Inn](https://goo.gl/maps/FxRhEM1pXBPNah8v5).

The next morning, James set off at 5:30am on Leg 1 of the JN. My plan was to swim in Ullswater, however, when I parked up, there was a lot of Algae, and I thought it best not swim. Instead, I drove to the top of Kirkstone Pass  and managed a short run up [Stony Cove Pike](https://www.strava.com/activities/1719329515) before meeting James back at Kirkstone Pass, the end of Leg 1. 

Unfortunatley Ian didn't complete the JN this time. However, we had a great day out, and met Alice for (second) breakfast at [Homeground](https://goo.gl/maps/d66Qe8VFcJWvS9FS6) in Windermere.
