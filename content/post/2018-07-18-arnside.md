* 1 night
* Wild camp at [Arnside Prom](https://goo.gl/maps/VoL98zRh39PAhTTA6)

Wednesday evening, James was out at running club. I decided spontaneously to do an overnight at Arnside. 
 
I arrived in time to do a [short 5k run](https://www.strava.com/activities/1711814852), pop to the Albion for a pint, and then settle down in the van with a hot chocolate. It was a fairly busy spot, 3 other campervans and lots of passing traffic in the night.

The next morning, I went for [another run](https://www.strava.com/activities/1712609484), before heading back to Lancaster to work.
