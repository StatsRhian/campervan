Set off on Friday night after work. We got to Moffat in time to get chips. Parked up at Grey Mares Tail. Some campervans but a quiet night. Up early in the morning, to have a quick run up to the tarn, before porridge and the drive up to the Trossachs.

We stopped at Callander to get a (second) veggie breakfast from [Deli Ecosse](https://deliecosse.co.uk/). before walking up [Ben Ledi](https://www.strava.com/activities/1849606370) which was very rainy. We arked up at Drummund Trout farm, a CL for two nights.

Next day we planned a walk in the Ben Lawers area. 
Originally, the plan was to follow the ridge along to Beinn nan Eachan, however, because it was super windy, we ended up cutting the walk short, turning back at [Meall nan Tarmachan](https://www.strava.com/activities/1849608267).
It was really pretty area and I'd like to go back and explore more of the Ben Lawers range sometime.

We stopped at a [The Courie Inn](http://www.thecourieinn.com/) in Killin to warm up with a pint, and bought some supplies to take back to the van for a cosy evening.

On our final day, we drove to Arrochar with an eye on doing [The Cobbler](https://connect.jumpingrivers.cloud/connect/#/apps/330/access/124). Again the weather was against us, and the views were lacking, but we enjoyed the walk. Another one to do again. 
We only paid for 3 hours in the car park and had to sprint down the last section. We made it back with minutes to spare. We moved to a scenic spot for tea and cake in the van before driving back down to Lancaster.
