* 1 night
* Wild camp at [Torver](https://goo.gl/maps/TFQFrLn1jj2N1UFG6)

My brother Tom and his girlfriend Pluggy were staying in the Lake District and we'd planned to go mountain biking in Grizedale. The night before, James and I slept drove up late to Torver for our first night in the campervan.

We'd eaten beforehand so it was just a case of parking up and getting to sleep. When we arrived, there was another campervan at the parking spot. It was a warm evening but cold night. We'd left the roof tent open and woke cold in the night. 

The morning was bright and warm. James did a [long run up Coniston](https://www.strava.com/activities/1602315750) the next day, whilst I went [mountain biking with Tom, Pluggy and Andy](https://www.strava.com/activities/1601771956).
