* 1 night
* Wild camp at [Torver](https://goo.gl/maps/TFQFrLn1jj2N1UFG6)

Tom was staying in the lake district and we'd planned to go mountain biking in Grizedale. The night before, James and I slept out at Torver. 

Warm evening but cold night. We'd left the roof tent open and woke cold in the night.

James did a long run up Coniston the next day.
