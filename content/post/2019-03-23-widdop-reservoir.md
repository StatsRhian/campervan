* 1 night
* Wild camp at [Widdop Reservoir](https://goo.gl/maps/a148smyNs3XFP5nq5)

James had signed up for the [Heptonstall Fell Race](https://heptonstallfellrace.wordpress.com/), and we decided to head over the night before for our first campervan trip of 2019. We were suitably excited.

I'd identified a lay-by alongside Widdop reservoir on Google maps that looked like an ideal park up spot. From the lay-by, we would only have a ten minute drive to Heptenstall village for the start of the race. 

We set off mid-afternoon, stopping off at Sainsburies in Colne to stock up on treats for the evening. The lay-by was empty when we arrived, and we parked up, and headed out for a [short walk around the reservoir](https://www.strava.com/activities/2238190550).

The next morning, after the usual porridge, we drove into Hepstonstall ready for the start of the race. We're quite early, and so we wandered around the quiet, pretty, cobbled streets. [Heptonstall museum](https://museums.calderdale.gov.uk/visit/heptonstall-museum) had opened especially early to welcome fell runners, so we popped in to have a look around, and were greeted with a free cup of coffee which was much appreciated.

The fell race traditionally starts on the narrow cobbled streets of Heptonstall, and is started with blessing from the local vicar. Whilst James was [racing up and down hills](https://www.strava.com/activities/2238174218), I [jogged through Hebden Beck valley](https://www.strava.com/activities/2238191502) to catch him half way. The hardest part was running past the Mill cafe knowing that I didn't have time to stop for an ice-cream. After cheering something supportive, it was a dash back to the finish line, James on the hilly route, myself taking the [direct road route](https://www.strava.com/activities/2238192032). I made it back just in time to watch James come through the finish line. After a pie and a pint at the Cross Inn we headed back to Lancaster.
