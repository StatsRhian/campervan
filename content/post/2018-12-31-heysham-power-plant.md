* 1 night
* Layby near [Ocean Edge holiday park](https://goo.gl/maps/hWXfUbYpBJH1vMGN7)

Keen to start the new year in an adventerous manner, I decided we would do a local wild camp on New Year's Eve. James, however, was more keen on having an early night. I won, so at 10pm, we bundled into the van and drove to the coast. My first two parking spots both had "No Overnight parking" signs, so we had to get creative. 

I found a spot near Heysham, which I thought would be nice and quiet. A little cold, we settled down for the evening. 

We were woken many times in the evening, by noises from the local power station, horns of passing ferries, the bright street light outside the van, and a bunch of joy riders at 4am. 

In the morning, tired and grumpy, James had a short jog along the coast, whilst I drove to meet him at Morrisons cafe for a breakfast and lots of coffee.

Not my best idea.
