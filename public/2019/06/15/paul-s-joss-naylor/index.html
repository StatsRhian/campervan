<p>Paul Tynan decided to have an attempt at the <a href="https://jossnaylor.blogspot.com/p/blog-page.html">Joss Naylor Challenger</a> and James was down to support leg 4 which covers the Wastdale Valley. I <a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/2452408449">hiked up</a> with James to the start of leg 4 which is at the stretcher box at Styhead. Once we had cheered Paul through, James ran off to do <a href="">leg 4</a> and I ran back down into the valley with one of the leg 3 supporters.</p>

<p>Whilst the runners were making their way over Great Gable, Kirk Fell and Pillar, I decided to swim in Wastwater. It&rsquo;s the deepest lake in the Lake District and often one of the coldest so I was a little nervous. Kitted out in my wetsuit I hobbled over the rocky shore and into the lake. I <a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/2455354148">swam out and back</a> across the width of the lake, waving to some kayakers. I found the swim quiet challenging as I got quite sea-sick half way back and was glad to make it out on to dry land.</p>

<p>Once dry and warm, I headed to Greendale Bridge to await the runners. As they came running down the hill, Joss Naylor appeared to shake Paul&rsquo;s hand and drink some fizz in plastic cups.</p>

<p>Paul was booked into the YHA Wastwater Hall, so we called in to join him for a celebratory pint, before driving around the corner to our park up, a small car park near Santon Bridge. We were the only ones there and had an early night.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The next morning we went for a walk straight from the van, up <a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/2455356903">Illgill Head</a>. It was a great ridge, and we saw hardly any people. It was very misty on top, but we did manage a couple of nice views of Wastwater.</p>

<p>After a cuppa and some snacks in the van, we drove around to Ravenglass for a <a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/2455357482">short walk along the seaside</a>. We stopped off at <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Restaurant_Review-g499564-d5017893-Reviews-Crakeside_Fish_Chips-Ulverston_Lake_District_Cumbria_England.html">Crakeside Fish and Chips</a> for dinner on the drive home.</p>
