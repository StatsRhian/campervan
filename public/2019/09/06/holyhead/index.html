<p>I booked a weekend Intro-mediate sea kayking course with <a href="https://www.seakayakinganglesey.co.uk/">Sea Kayaking Anglesey</a>. I&rsquo;d done a course with them previously and really enjoyed it so thought I&rsquo;d book another session. We headed down to North Wales quiet late as I&rsquo;d been working in Northern Ireland all week and hadn&rsquo;t packed any kayaking gear. We did the obligatory A55 takeaway stop at Queensferry, Deeside. By the time we arrived at our wild camp spot it was time for bed.</p>

<p>In the morning, I think I&rsquo;d forgotten where we were and was surprised to see the sea from the van door. I drove around the corner to the meet point at <a href="https://www.angleseyoutdoors.com/">Anglesea Outdoors</a> which would also be our campsite for this evening.  James set off to explore the <a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/2692914274">North Coast</a> of Anglesey by bike, whilst we headed to Menai Bridge. Most of the other paddlers were new to kayaking so I was relatively experienced by comparison (although that didn&rsquo;t stop me accidentally dropping the kayak!) We paddled in the sheltered stretch of the <a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/2688070335">Menai Strait</a> and practised strokes and rescues.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>We had a quiet evening on the campsite, grabbing food and a drink at <a href="https://www.paddlersreturn.co.uk/">The Paddlers Return </a>. Both tired from an energetic day we had an early night. The next morning, James set off early cycling to <a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/2692914022">Llandudno</a>. I headed back over to the Paddlers Return for a coffee and to plan the day&rsquo;s paddling.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>The decision was made to paddle from <a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/2692178570">Porth Dafarch to Trearddur Bay</a>. I&rsquo;ve paddled here before and really enjoyed the rock hopping so it was nice to have the opportunity to return. As the day went on the swell increased, which gave us a good opportunity to practise our skills in choppier water. Phil was a fantastic coach over the two days and I left the course feeling even more inspired to get out sea kayaking.</p>

<p>When I arrived at Llandudno, James had just arrived and was waiting for me on the prom. We called in to my Nain and Taid&rsquo;s flat for a suprise visit, before grabbing a <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Barnacles+Fish+%26+Chips/@53.3222664,-3.8250898,17.22z/data=!4m13!1m7!3m6!1s0x4864e1e2afa75737:0x6c919e5e368577e0!2sLlandudno!3b1!8m2!3d53.324061!4d-3.827609!3m4!1s0x0:0x18f68e024ca96879!8m2!3d53.3224961!4d-3.8247258">chippy tea</a> and driving back up North.</p>
