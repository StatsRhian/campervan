<li>1 night</li>
<li>Wild camp at <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/a148smyNs3XFP5nq5">Widdop Reservoir</a></li>
</ul>
<p>James had signed up for the <a href="https://heptonstallfellrace.wordpress.com/">Heptonstall Fell Race</a>, and we decided to head over the night before for our first campervan trip of 2019. We were suitably excited.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I&rsquo;d identified a lay-by alongside Widdop reservoir on Google maps that looked like an ideal park up spot. From the lay-by, we would only have a ten minute drive to Heptenstall village for the start of the race.</p>
<p>We set off mid-afternoon, stopping off at Sainsburys in Colne to stock up on treats for the evening. The lay-by was empty when we arrived, and we parked up, and headed out for a <a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/2238190550">short walk around the reservoir</a>.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The next morning, after the usual porridge, we drove into Hepstonstall ready for the start of the race. We&rsquo;re quite early, and so we wandered around the quiet, pretty, cobbled streets. <a href="https://museums.calderdale.gov.uk/visit/heptonstall-museum">Heptonstall museum</a> had opened especially early to welcome fell runners, so we popped in to have a look around, and were greeted with a free cup of tea which was much appreciated.</p>

<p>The fell race traditionally starts on the narrow cobbled streets of Heptonstall, and is started with blessing from the local vicar. Whilst James was <a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/2238174218">racing up and down hills</a>, I <a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/2238191502">jogged through Hebden Beck valley</a> to catch him half way. The hardest part was running past the Mill cafe knowing that I didn&rsquo;t have time to stop for an ice-cream. After cheering something supportive, it was a dash back to the finish line, James on the hilly route, myself taking the <a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/2238192032">direct road route</a>. I made it back just in time to watch James come through the finish line. After chilli and a pint at the Cross Inn we headed back to Lancaster.</p>
