      <description>Due to Covid, our first trip out in 2020 was in August, when I had a sea kayaking day booked at St Bees. James decided to join me, hoping to get in a couple of long rides across the Western Lake Distict. So one sunny Saturday afternoon, I dropped him off at the Lakeland Motor Museum carpark and I drove the around the coastal road whilst James cycled the pretty roads over Corney Fell.</description>

      <description>2 nights Wild camp at Porth Dafarch Campsite at Anglesey Outdoors  I booked a weekend Intro-mediate sea kayking course with Sea Kayaking Anglesey. I&amp;rsquo;d done a course with them previously and really enjoyed it so thought I&amp;rsquo;d book another session. We headed down to North Wales quiet late as I&amp;rsquo;d been working in Northern Ireland all week and hadn&amp;rsquo;t packed any kayaking gear. We did the obligatory A55 takeaway stop at Queensferry, Deeside.</description>
