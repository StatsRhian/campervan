</ul>

<p>Keen to start the new year in an adventerous manner, I decided we would do a local wild camp on New Year&rsquo;s Eve. James, however, was more keen on having an early night. I won, so at 10pm, we bundled into the van and drove to the coast. My first two parking spots both had &ldquo;No Overnight parking&rdquo; signs, so had to get creative.</p>

<p>I found a spot near Heysham, which I thought would be nice and quiet. A little cold, we settled down for the evening.</p>

<p>We were woken many times in the evening, by noises from the local power station, horns of passing ferries, the bright street light outside the van, and a bunch of joy riders at 4am.</p>

<p>In the morning, tired and grumpy, James had a short jog along the coast, whilst I drove to meet him at Morrisons cafe for a breakfast and lots of coffee.</p>

<p>Not my best idea.</p>
